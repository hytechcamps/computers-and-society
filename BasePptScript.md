## Slide 1
Hello, and welcome to the Computers & Society Hy-Tech Camp! `<click>`

## Slide 2
Let's start by talking about science fiction. **Does anyone have any examples of science fiction books, movies, or TV shows?** Yeah, those are some good answers! Sometimes, ideas that began as science fiction have become true science. Here are some examples: `<click>`

- Video Calls `<click>`
- Self-Driving Cars `<click>`
- A.I. Powered Voice Assistants `<click>`
- Virtual Reality `<click>`
- even Space Stations!

**Does anyone recognize any of these examples?** Here is a quick rundown: the video call and space station are from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The self-driving car is from I, Robot. The voice assistant is from Her. The virtual reality is from Johnny Mnemonic.

We will explore the impact of some of these technologies throughout this session. `<click>`

## Slide 3
Here is our agenda for this presentation. `<click>`

We will start by talking about the past - we'll talk about how we got here, and how computers have impacted society throughout history. `<click>`

Next, we'll discuss the present - we'll talk about how computing technology is currently impacting us. `<click>`

Finally, we'll get into the future - we'll go over how emerging and hypothetical technologies might change the world.

Note that we'll only really scratch the surface when it comes to each of these areas - but we hope you will walk away with some ideas about how computers continue to alter society. `<click>`

## Slide 4
Let's begin by discussing just some of the history of computers. `<click>`

## Slide 5
This picture of an IBM Data Center from the 1960s shows how computers used to look - a lot has changed! `<click>`

Back then, computers were basically just giant calculators used for scientific and engineering equations. `<click>`

Most applications were for the military or academic operations - they did a lot of code-breaking and general research. Computers weren't really designed for personal use - `<click>`

In fact, in 1977, tech entrepreneur Ken Olson stated that "There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home." Smash cut to... `<click>`

## Slide 6
1977, the advent of the personal computer. `<click>`

Three very important computers were released this year that would be dubbed the "Trinity" - The Commodore PET, the Apple II, and the TRS-80. **Now, which one of those companies is still around today?** Yes, you probably recognize Apple. The TRS-80 is actually from Radio Shack - **Raise your hand if you've heard of Radio Shack.** Gone but not forgotten. Anyway, these computers were the first successful mass-market personal computers - by the standards of the 70s, they were "affordable" and "usable." `<click>`

**So, what do you think they could do?** Those are some good ideas. Here's some examples - `<click>` - many of these features are still around today. `<click>` Beyond some of the similarities, **what's changed? How are computers different now?** Right, those are some good differences! `<click>`

## Slide 7
One of the biggest changes since 1977 is the World Wide Web - what we know of today as "The Internet." Let's take a quick peek at a video introducing the internet (because I'm sure none of you know what it is). `<play video>`

The internet has gone through many phases over the years. `<click>`

It started with Web 1.0 - back in the day, the internet was mostly read-only; you had to be very technical in order to create content on the web. People would mainly browse sites like Yahoo and read articles. `<click>`

Next came Web 2.0 - this was the social web, where users started to be able to create their own content without too much technical knowledge. **Does anyone recognize these two logos?** That's right, this is Twitter and Myspace. **Can anyone name other social media or places where users generate their own content?** YouTube, Instagram, TikTok - these are all examples of Web 2.0 technology. `<click>`

After Web 2.0, some say we are currently entering Web 3.0 - this phrase is often used in conjunction with blockchain technology. The main idea is to decentralize ownership of the web, so that all the content is not housed by Google or Amazon or Facebook. This is more of a future state than a current paradigm. Regardless, the web will continue to grow and evolve, just like other computing technology! `<click>`

## Slide 8
Speaking of growth and evolution, let's talk about arts and entertainment. **How have computers had an impact on these areas?** Right, there are a ton of examples. `<click>`

One instance is electronic music. `<click>` We've come a long way. The first recording of computer-generated music was in 1951 - it sounded like this. `<play clip 1>` **Does anyone recognize that song?** That's right, it's the very patriotic "My Country 'Tis of Thee."

60 years later, entire albums can be generated using computers. `<click>` Here's an example from Com Truise - this track is called Memory. `<play clip 2>`. In fact, most pop music these days is created digitally, without any mechanical instruments.

Another industry that has been changed a lot by computers is film - `<click>` - Computer-Generated Imagery has come a long way. `<click>`

Here is one of the earliest instances of CGI, from 1974. `<click>`

And here's a modern example, from Avatar 2. Nowadays, entire films can be generated using this type of CGI - like the Lion King remake. Computers have made all of this possible, and it looks like they will continue to improve exponentially. `<click>`

## Slide 9
One way of tracking this improvement is through Moore's Law. `<click>` Here it is: The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. **What do you think this quote means?** Alright, good guess. Basically, it means that technology will keep getting better and better, at faster and faster rates. `<click>`

Here's a graph - things started off pretty slow in 1900, but have steadily sped up through the last century or so. And now, after all the years of the past, we have entered the present. `<click>`

## Slide 10
In this section, we will discus some of the ways computers impact the present day. `<click>`

## Slide 11
Here's a question - **what is a computer?** Close! It's kind of tough to answer, right? `<click>`

You might think of just a desktop computer, but computers really are everywhere. A computer can be:

- `<click>` A laptop or chromebook
- `<click>` A tablet like an iPad
- `<click>` A smartphone like an iPhone
- `<click>` A smart watch
- `<click>` A video game console like a GameCube
- `<click>` A giant server or data warehouse
- `<click>` Even a barcode scanner

These are all part of our daily lives, and they are all computers! `<click>`

## Slide 12
Now let's dive into a specific area of impact in modern times - Covid 19. **Can someone tell me how computers affected Covid 19 lockdowns?** Those are all correct! `<click>`

One of the biggest things was video call technology - software like Zoom and FaceTime. `<click>`

These made it possible to do remote work _and_ remote learning when it wasn't safe to be in-person! Pretty great, right? But this didn't necessarily work out well for everyone. **Has anyone ever heard of the Digital Divide?** Well, we'll tell you about it. `<click>`

Basically, the digital divide is the idea that a lot of people (especially low-income, elderly, and disabled people) do not have access to computers or the internet, while others do. It may be easy to think that _everyone_ has a smart phone, or a home computer, or internet access - but that is far from the truth. Covid 19 made this divide even more impactful - with "everyone" heading to Zoom, many were left behind. `<click>`

Here's a question, see if you can guess the answer - **How many people across the world have never used the internet?** Close! `<click>` The answer is a staggering 2.9 billion. Think about how this lack of access might affect their lives. And you might be thinking, well, that's just the whole world. Surely, in the United States, it's much better. `<click>`

Here's another question - **What percentage of Cleveland households had no access to the internet in 2018?** Not too far off - `<click>` The answer is 27%. That's a lot of people! **Any idea why?** Okay, yeah, some of the stuff that was mentioned earlier. This generally represents a socio-economic gap, as well as a racial one. Geography also has a big impact - people who live in more rural areas have a much more difficult time finding high speed internet connections.

All of these factors make it harder for these people to access the important technologies that are changing our world. `<click>`

## Slide 13
**Can anyone name any new, modern technologies that are available now?** We briefly talked about some of them.

- `<click>` Artificial intelligence
- `<click>` Extended Reality (like VR and AR)
- `<click>` Smart devices
- `<click>` 3D printing

All of these things will continue to alter the world around us! `<click>`

## Slide 14
Now we've seen a few examples of current technology, and how it has affected society... what could that look like in the future? `<click>`

## Slide 15
There are two main categories of future technologies we will discuss: emerging and hypothetical. `<click>`

We'll start with emerging technologies. `<click>`

These technologies must actually exist in some way, BUT `<click>`

They must not be mainstream. `<click>`

There are a few phases they could be in, like research (the preliminary stages), prototype (actually having some version of the technology), development (active work on the technology) or diffusion, when the technology works and is in the process of becoming mainstream. `<click>`

**Can you think of any examples of emerging technologies?** That's good! We already talked about a few. Here are some examples: `<click>`

Self-driving cars, virtual reality, android robots, and quantum computing. `<click>`

Next, let's talk about hypothetical technologies. `<click>`

Unlike emerging technologies, these things must not exist at all! `<click>`

They are often the subject of works of  science fiction. `<click>`

The fun part is that they _might_ exist in the future! `<click>`

**Can anyone give me an example of a hypothetical technology?** Sure, yep! Here are some: `<click>`

Time machines, teleporters, water-fueled cars, or immortality. These things _probably_ won't happen, but who knows! `<click>`

## Slide 16
Let's dive a little deeper into some hypothetical technologies that also might happen. `<click>`

One big innovation could be molecular nanocomputers - these would be able to construct and deconstruct matter at the atomic level. `<click>`

If this were possible, we could create something called a Santa Claus machine - something that could take in any for of matter (like rocks, dirt, or trash), rearrange the molecules, and output any other object. `<click>`

Taking that idea a step further, there is the idea of a Von Neumann `[NOY-man]` Probe - a self-replicating spacecraft. These probes could explore the far reaches of the galaxy, landing on planets, harvesting resources, and rebuilding themselves. `<click>`

Another interesting topic is whole-brain emulation - the idea of taking a human brain and representing it entirely in a digital form. `<click>`

One thing that could arise from this would be mind uploading - like the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, this could lead to digital immortality. `<click>`

Another potential application would be thought recording - if you can represent experience, and maybe even share your experience with others... what would the consequences be?

We won't get too deep into any discussions here, but hopefully these ideas have made you think a little bit. `<click>`

## Slide 17
Now, let's summarize a bit of what we learned. `<click>`

## Slide 18
We started with the past - **Does anyone have examples of how computers have impacted society in history?** `<click>` Old-school computers, the internet, and other digital technology has impacted our culture, economy, and society.

**Can anyone give me a good takeaway point about computers in the past?** Nice.

Next, we moved onto the present - **Does anyone have examples of how computers currently impact our society?** `<click>` Current computer technologies like smart phones, A.I., video calls, VR, and more continue to impact society.

**Can anyone give me a good takeaway point about computers in the present?** Nice.

Next, we moved onto the future - **Does anyone have examples of how computers might impact our society in the future?** `<click>` Emerging technologies AND hypothetical technologies will have an impact on society as they evolve.

**Can anyone give me a good takeaway point about computers in the future?** Nice.

Now let's talk about _your_ impact - `<click>` - as members of Gen Z, you will be the ones who work with these new technologies and use them to shape society. Keep that in mind as you continue to learn more and explore new ideas. You could change the world someday. `<click>`

## Slide 19
Alright, that's it for the presentation. Does anyone have any questions? No? Alright cool.
