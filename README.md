# Computers & Society
In this discussion-based camp, students will learn how emerging technologies are impacting our world. They will have a chance to explore some of the latest ideas in computer science and see how their own ideas could contribute to the evolution of society. There will be conversations about the ethical implications of new software paradigms, the philosophies behind various innovations, and the technological future that lies ahead.

## Icebreaker
For the icebreaker, have each student follow [these instructions](Icebreaker.md). They will create an avatar using [readyplayer.me](https://readyplayer.me/avatar).

1. Introduce the activity, and go through an example so they can see the steps in action
1. Give them 3-5 minutes to create their avatars, and share them via [this google form](https://forms.gle/nrSLJzVycNWxDBBg9)
1. Go through each response for the given room in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Ra8hv3zSXJLufTuUtwvIwoq3zrJynOkwg6SsCAvGD0/edit?usp=sharing)
1. Have each student share a bit about themselves (name, grade, school) along with any interesting notes about what they made

## Lecture - PowerPoint
Present the [Computers & Society PowerPoint](ComputersAndSociety.pptx). There are lots of notes on each slide - be sure to review them ahead of time. The presentation is designed to be very interactive - make sure to ask questions and let the students lead the discussion. Some of the slides have questions directly, and there are more questions in the slide notes as well.

## Formative Assessment - Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket game/quiz](). You must have a Blooket account in order to host the game. There are several game options - see if the students have a preference, and set the time limit based on how much time is remaining in the session (~10 minutes is probably a good duration in general, but could go up or down depending).

## Self-Paced Work - Further Exploration
Direct the students to the [Self-Paced Work](SelfPacedWork.md) after the game. They will have a few different options to get creative and dive deeper into some of the topics covered by the lecture.

With some time remaining, have students share their work if they would like.
