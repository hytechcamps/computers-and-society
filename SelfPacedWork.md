# Self-Paced Work - Envisioning the Future
Choose an option below to continue exploring the topics covered in the lecture, and get creative!

## Options
There are two main options.

### Option 1 - World-Building and Narrative
For this option, you will create a future world, and tell a story that takes place in that world.

### Option 2 - Business Plan and Marketing
For this option, you will create a product to sell, and write some ad copy for the product.

## Getting Started
To being with either option, you will want to follow a few steps:

1. Choose a technology (or technologies) to use in your project
    - Keep in mind, the technology should be either _emerging_ or _hypothetical_
    - You can also come up with a totally new hypothetical technology idea!
1. Research that technology to see how it has been used
    - For an emerging technology, try to figure out some of its real-world applications
    - For a hypothetical technology, find some places where it has been used in science fiction
1. Keep track of your notes in a new text file, word document, Google doc, or on paper!

### Technology Ideas
There are a ton of technologies out there that could make for some great stories. Here is a small sampling of options:

- Self-driving cars
- Artificial general intelligence
- Virtual reality worlds
- Advanced smart devices
- Robots
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Quantum computers
- Mind uploading
- Thought recording
- Self-replicating spacecrafts

## Putting the Project Together
After doing some preliminary research, it's time to start putting it to use! The questions on the form are outlined below.

**Use this form to walk through each part: [https://forms.gle/xyQTcqkaDmsg5v448](https://forms.gle/xyQTcqkaDmsg5v448)**

### Option 1 - Template
For the world-building/narrative, there will be a few things you'll want to come up with:

#### The World
- What year does your world exist?
- Have governments been impacted by the new technology?
- Have arts & culture been impacted by the new technology?
- Have business & labor been impacted by the new technology?
- Is the world a [utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia)? A [dystopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia)? Something in between?

#### The Main Character
- What is the main character's name?
- What is their job?
- Do they have any other important characteristics?
- How does the new technology impact them in their daily life?

#### The Story
The story can take many different forms, but it may be beneficial to follow a traditional storytelling structure. One good one is the [story spine](https://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2013/06/05/back-to-the-story-spine/).

The important thing is that the reader should get to see your main character experience your world and interact with the futuristic technology.

### Option 2 - Template
For the business plan, you'll want to come up with a few different things:

#### Basic Product / Company Info
- What problem does your product solve?
- How does your product solve that problem?
- How is your product different from other products on the market now?
- What is the mission statement of the company?

#### Sales
- Will you sell your product to businesses or consumers?
- Who is your target audience?
    - Age range, interests, occupations, other demographics
- How much will your product cost? What will your pricing models look like?
- How will you market your product? Will you have advertisements on TV, social media, podcasts, etc?

#### The Pitch / Ad Copy
This can take many different forms, but the main idea is this: write a paragraph or two selling your product. Talk about the problem being solved, the benefits of your solution, the potential applications of the technology, and why someone should purchase it.
