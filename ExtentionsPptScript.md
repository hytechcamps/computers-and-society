# Extensions PowerPoint Script
Follow this script when presenting the [Computers & Society Extensions](ComputersAndSocietyExtensions.pptx). There are two options: **Option 1: Artificial Intelligence** and **Option 2: Extended Reality**. Students should be able to vote on which option they would like to discuss more. Each option has its own section below, and there are sections for each slide within those sections. Animations and transitions are designated with `<click>` markers. Questions to ask the students are bolded. When asking questions, try to make sure that a variety of students are answering - use cold calling if needed.

### Poll Questions
_Poll questions_ are also bolded, and begin with **Poll:**. For these questions, have each student put up fingers or answer in the Zoom chat:
- 1 for yes
- 2 for no
- 3 for maybe/not sure/depends

See where the classroom consensus ends up for each poll (if there is one), then ask students why they chose what they did. Try to choose one person who answered 1, one who answered 2, and one who answered 3. As with the regular questions, try to make sure that a good mix of students answer, and it's not always the same ones. Encourage discussion and debate, but be sure to moderate it appropriately.

## Option 1: Artificial Intelligence
This discussion should be driven from **Slide 2** through **Slide 5** inclusive.

### Slide 2
So you want to talk about A.I., huh? Let's start with some history. `<click>`

**Does anyone know who Alan Turing is?** They made a movie about him called _The Imitation Game_ where Benedict Cumberbatch played him. He did so much throughout his life, but for our purposes on this slide, he was known as the "father of artificial intelligence." We highly recommend reading more about him, he is an incredibly impactful and interesting person. `<click>`

One of his big contributions to the field was something called the "Turing Test" - a way to measure how "intelligent" an artificial agent actually is. There are three parties - the artificial intelligence (A), the human intelligence (B), and the judge (C) who is also a human. The judge has a conversation with A and B, with the goal of determining which one is a human, and which one is a computer. If the artificial intelligence successfully fools the judge into thinking it is the human, then it passes the test!

This test is not incredibly rigorous, but it does give one basis for discussing some of the philosophical ideas of intelligence. `<click>`

Here's a question for the group: **Poll: Can a machine think?** 1 for yes, 2 for no, 3 for maybe/not sure/it depends. Alright, interesting answers. Someone who said yes, want to tell us why? Okay. How about someone who said no? Alright, interesting! Let's move onto another question... `<click>`

**Poll: Can a machine actually become conscious?** Same rules as before, 1 for yes, 2 for no, 3 for maybe or not sure. Okay, good mix. Someone who said yes, tell me why! Someone who said no - tell me why! Good stuff. Couple more questions here: `<click>`

**Poll: Will an A.I. ever be as intelligent as a human?** In this case, we mean to ask if an A.I. can be _generally_ intelligent - i.e., able to solve any problem a human can solve. Good answers. Someone from each group tell me why. Okay. Final question for this slide: `<click>`

**Poll: Is the human mind a physical thing?** Alright, looks like we have some dualists and some physicalists here. Tell me why you chose those answers. Great! Now let's move away from the historical and into the modern. `<click>`

### Slide 3
In this day and age, A.I. is really everywhere. `<click>` **Raise your hand if you've ever used YouTube before.** Alright that's what I thought. **Does anyone know how YouTube uses A.I.?** Good ideas. `<click>` They probably use A.I. in a number of ways, but one of them is their recommendation engine. `<click>` This is possible because of deep learning and neural networks - we won't dive to deep into the details, but you may have heard those terms before. `<click>` Now, **how do you think they might measure the success of a recommendation engine?** Good ideas! They could do the number of a times a video was clicked... but **Why could that be bad?** It might just encourage clickbait! They actually measure the length of time watched after a video is clicked to see if it was a good recommendation. Even that might not be the best measurement though! It's all about defining success from their perspective. `<click>`

Another big area where A.I. is used is in facial recognition. **Can anyone tell me where they may have seen facial recognition?** Good ideas! `<click>` Things like TikTok or Snapchat or Instagram filters use facial recognition to do interesting things to videos and pictures. The Face ID on an iPhone is another example. **Anyone have an idea of some concerns with this technology?** `<click>` There are definitely a few. Data theft is one - big companies or even foreign governments could steal facial data and use it for malicious purposes. There's also algorithmic bias - imagine if a facial recognition software was used to identify criminals. Now, imagine the algorithm was only trained on white people, and can't recognize people of other races... this could be a serious issue for an individual identified as someone else based on race alone. `<click>`

How about self-driving cars? **Any ideas about ethical concerns in this area?** Interesting thoughts! `<click>` One big question is litigation - who gets in trouble if the car runs someone over? The driver? The programmer? Elon Musk? **What do you think?** This can also lead to technological unemployment - for example, what if all the truckers lose their jobs? **How can the economy handle that?** We won't dive too deep, but these are just some areas of discussion. `<click>`

Now, **can anyone tell me what a deepfake is?** `<click>` Here's a quick example of Jennifer Lawrence turning into Steve Buscemi. We'll dive into these more on the next slide. `<click>`

### Slide 4
We are going to talk a little more about these things called deepfakes. `<click>` **Does anyone recognize this person?** `<click>` You might know it's Kendrick Lamar... but it also looks a lot like Will Smith. This is made possible via "Deepfake" technology - `<click>` this is a portmanteau of "Deep learning" and "fake." This technology is pretty cool - `<click>` if you've seen the Star Wars movie Rogue One, you may recognize young Princess Leia - that appearance was possible because of a deepfake! `<click>` There is also a platform named Synthesia that generates 100% A.I.-based people for use in business videos, and potentially other media. `<play video 1>` Note that this is not a real person OR a real voice - it's totally fabricated! So there are some good uses of the technology, but... it's not all good. `<click>`

Take a look at this video. `<play video 2>` **Who do you think is speaking?** `<click>` It's actually Jordan Peele. `<play video 2 again>`. `<click>` Regardless of who said it, the message is true. Deepfakes can be used to spread dangerous misinformation - think about political figures being manipulated in this way. `<click>` There are many nefarious purposes for deepfakes, mainly involving fraud. `<click>` As the technology improves, these fake videos become more and more difficult to recognize - but companies like Twitter are working on tagging synthetic videos to make sure no one is misled.

Like most technology, these are an interesting tool that can be used for good, or bad. `<click>`

### Slide 5
Next, let's talk a bit about the future of artificial intelligence. **Does anyone have any ideas of how A.I. could impact the future?** Good ideas! We'll talk about a few. `<click>` One idea is government by algorithm - there have actually been some real-world examples of A.I. getting involved with politics and government. In Japan, an A.I. ran for public office. Also, in the 80s, there was a software called "Split Up" that handled divorce proceedings, and split up estates.

**Poll: Would you like to be governed by an artificial intelligence?** Alright, someone tell me why or why not! `<click>`

Another potential future could involve deepfake films - fully generated by A.I. The computer could create the visuals, the music, the dialog... it could even write the story! **Poll: Do you think a fully A.I.-generated movie would be good?** Someone tell me why it would be good, and why it would be bad. `<click>`

Now for a less realistic idea, depending on who you ask. **Can anyone tell me what the singularity is?** Alright, we'll tell you. `<click>` The singularity is a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. `<click>` This could cause an "intelligence explosion" - basically if an Artificial _General_ Intelligence is capable of improving itself, there's nothing stopping it from continuous improvement... which makes it get faster and faster and better and better at an ever-accelerating pace. This could lead to a _superintelligence_ - something humans could not even comprehend, way beyond any human intelligence. `<click>` One interesting though experiment is the idea of a paperclip-maximizing superintelligence - say one of these things had one goal: to create paperclips. It might neglect all other responsibilities and simply optimize its ability to create paperclips - thus destroying the universe and turning every bit of matter into paperclips. **Poll: Do you think a technological singularity will happen?** Alright, interesting!

Hopefully these extension slides made you think a little bit about A.I., and some of the scary and exciting things that could come from it. Thanks!

## Option 2: Extended Reality
This discussion should be driven from **Slides 6 and 7**.

### Slide 6
So you chose to talk about XR. Let's get into it. `<click>`

**Can someone tell me what VR is?** Good answer. `<click>` VR, which stands for Virtual Reality, is a fully-immersive simulated experience - it is meant to take the user into another world. **Anyone have examples of VR Headsets?** Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, Google Cardboard... there are quite a few! At this point, VR is largely used for entertainment, but it can also be used for education, training, healthcare, and more. `<click>`

**Now, can anyone tell me what AR is?** Nice! `<click>` AR stands for Augmented Reality. In AR, a layer of non-reality is added to normal reality. **Does anyone have examples of AR?** Nice! `<click>` If you ever played Pokémon Go, that uses AR! Google Maps is starting to do it too. **Anyone have an idea of how AR could be used in the future?** Outside of gaming, there are applications in art, commerce, architecture, and more. `<click>`

Now let's talk about the metaverse. **Raise your hand if you've heard of the metaverse. Anyone want to tell me what it means?** Alright. The term actually originated way back in 1992, in a novel by Neal Stephenson called Snow Crash - it's a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." The basic definition of the "metaverse" is: a universal immersive virtual world, generally facilitated by the use of VR and AR. The early stages can be seen in games like Second Life. `<click>`

Recently, the ideas of Blockchain and NFTs have been incorporated into the metaverse - _digital ownership_ is an important concept here. In fact, "virtual land" in the metaverse is selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars right now. Even though "virtual real estate" is kind of an oxymoron, people are willing to spend a lot of money to stake out their part of the future. `<click>`

So what do you think? **Poll: Is virtual real estate a good investment?** Hold up one for yes, two for no, or three for maybe/not sure/it depends. Zoom participants can enter their answers in the chat. Alright, someone who said yes - tell me why! Okay. Now someone who said no - tell me why! Interesting. We'll just have to see what the future holds. `<click>`

### Slide 7
Speaking of the future, let's talk about the future of XR. **Anyone have an idea of how these XR technologies could impact the future?** Nice! `<click>`

One possibility is a complete virtual society - **Raise your hand if you've seen or read Ready Player One.** It could end up being something like that! People might spend more time in VR than in real life - entire cultures, economies, and communities could exist digitally. In some ways, we already live like that, but this would be a whole other level! `<click>`

Another possibility that might be a little more "out there" involves the idea of a brain-computer interface. This technology already exists; prosthetic limbs are able to read impulses from the human brain so that people can control them... but what if it worked the other way? `<click>` What if it were possible to use a brain-computer interface to completely simulate a person's perception? If that's possible... extended reality might become so advanced that it is completely indistinguishable from our reality... how do we know we're not living in a simulated reality right this very moment? `<click>`

Let's see what everybody thinks. **Poll: Are we currently living in a simulation?** Again, one for yes, two for no, three for maybe. Okay, interesting. Anyone who said yes, want to justify your answer? Anyone who said no? The interesting thing is that there's no way to prove or disprove the idea. Now, here's another question... `<click>`

**Poll: Does it matter if we're living in a simulation?** Same rules as before, let's see what everybody thinks - alright, interesting again! Tell me why you chose those answers. Interesting thoughts. The world will probably never know.

Hopefully these extension slides made you think a little bit about XR, and some of the scary and exciting things that could come from it. Thanks!
